## Promises allow users to keep using a site while data from somewhere else is gathered in the background 

### Terms
**promise**
A promise returns a response but we cannot control the response .In dev speak , we say that function returns a promise when the function has asynchronous logic that other code depends upon before it can be executed.

**callback function**
Before promises were a thing we used callback functions to handle asynchronous code. callback functions were a headache if we ever needed to cal asynchronous logic sequentially. This was known as a callback hell. 

**`Promise`**
A class made available by JavaScript. We use an instance of this class to wrap asynchronous code.

**`async`/`await`**
The most recent way to implement a promise it fairly easy to read and reason about.
