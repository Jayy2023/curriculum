# Javascript Data tyoes 201
## Data types can be collections  in other structures like objects or arrays.
### Objects

An object describes something. It is lives inside of opening and closing curly brackets and is organized as key:value pairs, seperated by commas. The key and the value are themselves separated by a `:`.
```
const car = {
color: "Blue",
type: "Mercedes",
mileage: 16000,
isNew: false,
};
``` 

### Arrays
An array is a collection of items. It is defined by opening and closing square brackets. The items in the array are separated by commas. Each item in an array is indexed with a number .Arrays can contain all other data types as well as objects.

```
const fruits = ["Apples", "Orange", "Peaches"]; // string data type <
const ages = [3, 5, 6];
const car =[ 
    }
    color: Blue,
    type: "Mercedes",
    mileage: 16000,
    isNew: false,
    },
    {
        color: Green,
        type: "Mercedes",
        mileage: 189000,
        isNew: false,
    }, 
];
```
